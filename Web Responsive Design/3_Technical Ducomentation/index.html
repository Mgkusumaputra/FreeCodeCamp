            HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your
            content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to
            enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a
            certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a
            word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can
            make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the
            following line of content:
          </p>
          <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
          <p>
            If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it
            is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
          </p>
          <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_Of_An_Html_Element">
        <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
        <article>
          <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
          <img
            src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png"
            alt=""
          />
          <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the
              element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing
              <strong>angle brackets</strong>. This states where the element
              begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph
              begins.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening
              tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element
              name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the
              paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the
              standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element,
              which in this case, is just text.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag,
              and the content together comprise the element.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
          <img
            src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"
            alt=""
          />
          <p>
            Attributes contain extra information about the element that you
            don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the
            attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class
            attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier
            that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same
            class value) with style information and other things.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>An attribute should always have the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A space between it and the element name (or the previous
              attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
            </li>
            <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
            <li>
              The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation
              marks.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <code
            ><strong>Note:</strong> Simple attribute values that don't contain
            ASCII whitespace (or any of the characters " ' ` = < > ) can remain
            unquoted, but it is recommended that you quote all attribute values,
            as it makes the code more consistent and understandable.
          </code>

        <article>
          <p>
            You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called
            nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could
            wrap the word "very" in a &lt;strong&gt; element, which means that
            the word is to be strongly emphasized:
          </p>
          <code
            >&lt;p&gt;My cat is&lt;strong&gt;very&lt;strong&gt;grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
          <p>
            You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly
            nested. In the example above, we opened the
            &lt;p&gt; element first, then
            the &lt;strong&gt; element;
            therefore, we have to close the &lt;strong&gt; element first, then the
            &lt;p&gt; element. The
            following is incorrect:
          </p>
          <code
            >&lt;p&gt;My cat is&lt;strong&gt;very
            grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code
          >
          <p>
            The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are
            clearly inside or outside one another. If they overlap as shown
            above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at what
            you were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So
            don't do it!
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Empty_Element">
        <header>Empty Element</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Take
            the
            <span
              >&lt;img&gt;
            element that we already have in our HTML page:
          </p>
          <code
            >&lt;img src="image/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;</code
          >
          <p>
            This contains two attributes, but there is no closing
            <span
              >&lt;/img&gt;
            tag and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't
            wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the
            HTML page in the place it appears.

          <p>
            That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they
            aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements
            are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code we
            put into our index.html example (which we first met in the Dealing
            with files article):
          </p>
          <code
            >&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta
            charset="utf-8"&gt; &lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png"
            alt="My test image"&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</code
          >
          <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the
              mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were
              meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to
              follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic
              error checking and other useful things. However these days, they
              don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your
              document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.
            </li>
            <li>
              &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt; — the &lt;html&gt; element. This element
              wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as
              the root element.
            </li>
            <li>
              &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; — the &lt;head&gt; element. This element
              acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the
              HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's
              viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description
              that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our
              content, character set declarations, and more.
            </li>
            <li>
              &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; — This element sets the character set
              your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters
              from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can
              now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no
              reason not to set this and it can help avoid some problems later
              on.
            </li>
            <li>
              &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; — the &lt;title&gt; element. This sets
              the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the
              browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the
              page when you bookmark/favorite it.
            </li>
            <li>
              &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; — the &lt;body&gt; element. This
              contains all the content that you want to show to web users when
              they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games,
              playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Images">
          <header>Images</header>
          <article>
            <p>Let's turn our attention to the &lt;img&gt; element again:</p>
            <code>&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;</code>
            <p>
                As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the src (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In this attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the alt text to them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately changing the path inside your src attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the page, you should see something like this in place of the image:
                </li>
            </ol>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/alt-text-example.png" alt="">
            <p>
                The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."
            </p>
            <p>Try coming up with some better alt text for your image now.</p>
          </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Headings">
          <header>Headings</header>
          <article>
            <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, &lt;h1&gt;–&lt;h6&gt;, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:</p>
            <code>&lt;h1&gt;My main title&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;>My top level heading&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;>My subheading&lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;h4&gt;>My sub-subheading&lt;/h4&gt;</code>
                <p>Now try adding a suitable title to your HTML page just above your &lt;img&gt; element.</p>
              <code><strong>Note:</strong> You'll see that your heading level 1 has an implicit style. Don't use heading elements to make text bigger or bold, because they are used for accessibility and other reasons such as SEO. Try to create a meaningful sequence of headings on your pages, without skipping levels.</code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Paragraphs">
          <header>Paragraphs</header>
          <article>
              <p>As explained above, &lt;p&gt; elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content:</p>
              <code>&lt;p&gt;This is a single paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code>
              <p>Add your sample text (you should have it from What will your website look like?) into one or a few paragraphs, placed directly below your &lt;img&gt; element.</p>
          </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Lists">
          <header>Lists</header>
          <article>
            A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a &lt;ul&gt; element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an &lt;ol&gt; element.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Each item inside the lists is put inside an &lt;li&gt; (list item) element.</p>
            <p>For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following paragraph fragment into a list</p>
            <code>&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we’re a global community of technologists, thinkers, and builders working together ... &lt;/p&gt;</code>
            <p>We could modify the markup to this</p>
            <code>&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we’re a global community of&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;technologists&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;thinkers&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;builders&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                
                &lt;p&gt;working together ... &lt;/p&gt;</code>
            <p>Try adding an ordered or unordered list to your example page.</p>
          </article>
        <section class="main-section" id="Links">
            <header>Links</header>
            <article>
                <p>Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element — &lt;a&gt; — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wrap the text in an &lt;a&gt; element, as shown below:
                    </li>
                    <code>&lt;a&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                    <li>
                        Give the &lt;a&gt; element an href attribute, as shown below:
                    </li>
                    <code>&lt;a href=""&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                    <li>
                        Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to link to:
                    </li>
                    <code>&lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/"&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    You might get unexpected results if you omit the https:// or http:// part, called the protocol, at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.
